## üìÇ Directory Overview

### `asuswrt-merlin/vlan-setup/`
Scripts for configuring VLANs and Wi-Fi bridges on Asus routers running Asuswrt-Merlin firmware. Each subdirectory targets a specific router model:

- **AC3100, AC68U, AC55, AX11000**:  
  - `*.sh`: Main VLAN and bridge setup scripts for each model.
  - `aimesh-vlan-bridge.sh`: VLAN bridge script for AiMesh nodes.
  - `services-start`: Boot hook to auto-run scripts at startup.
  - `README.md`: Model-specific setup instructions.

These scripts automate:
- VLAN interface creation and bridge mapping
- NVRAM updates for persistent configuration
- Safe detachment/cleanup of old interfaces
- Guest Wi-Fi isolation and AP mode bridging

### `cockpit/`
Automated deployment of [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/) across multiple Linux hosts.

- **cockpit-fleet.sh**:  
  - Distributes SSH keys and installs Cockpit on a fleet of servers.
  - Supports parallel execution and detailed logging.
  - CLI flags for flexible operation (`--keys-only`, `--install-only`, `--parallel`).
- **README.md**:  
  - Usage instructions, requirements, and advanced tips.

### `Prox-GPU/`
Guides and snippets for enabling GPU passthrough in Proxmox LXC containers.

- **Readme.md**:  
  - Step-by-step instructions for host and container setup.
  - Covers driver installation, cgroup configuration, and NVIDIA Container Toolkit.
